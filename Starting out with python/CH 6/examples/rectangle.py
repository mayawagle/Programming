#The rectangle module has functions that perform
#calculations related to rectangles

#the area function accepts a rectangle's width
#and length as arguments and returns the rectangles area
def area(width, length):
    return width * length

#The perimeter function accepts a rectangle's width
#and length as arguments and returns the rectangle's perimeter
def perimeter(width, length):
    return 2 * (width + length)
